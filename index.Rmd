## Bio

Shalmali Bane is a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist living in the Bay Area, 
California. She received her doctorate in Epidemiology and Population Health in 2024
from Stanford University. Her dissertation examined the association of neighborhood 
factors and birth hospital with racial and ethnic disparities in low-risk cesarean 
birth, as well as cesarean birth as a means to reduce downstream severe maternal 
morbidity. During her time at Stanford, she held teaching roles in the departments of
Epidemiology, Biology, and Theater and Performance Studies for courses including 
Genetics, Intermediate Epidemiology, and Improvisation. She is interested in the 
application advanced epidemiological methods such as causal inference as well as 
community-engaged methodologies to facilitate the rigorous and equitable study of
pregnancy. Her research covers healthcare resource use (abortion, cesarean birth), 
maternal outcomes (severe maternal morbidity), perinatal outcomes (stillbirth, 
periviable birth), and social epidemiology (racial and ethnic disparities, socioeconomic
position, sexual orientation and gender idendity). Dr. Bane hopes her research 
supports improving reproductive care safely and equitably *for all who choose to give birth*.
