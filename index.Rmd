## Bio

Shalmali Bane is a reproductive and perinatal epidemiologist from India; she currently lives in San Francisco. She is interested in the application of causal inference and advanced epidemiological methods as well as community-engaged research practices to facilitate the rigorous and equitable study of pregnancy. Dr. Bane hopes her research supports improving reproductive care safely and equitably *for all who choose to give birth*.

Outside of work, she can be found sewing her own clothes, watching CBS's Survivor, or spending time with her cat.
